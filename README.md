# Partial clone of iPhone 15 Pro website - https://www.apple.com/pl/iphone-15-pro/

Created with React, Typescript, GSAP and ThreeJS.

During the project, I learned how to animate with GSAP, how to work with ThreeJS in React and the basics of displaying 3D models on a website using ThreeJS.
I also learned how to integrate React app with Sentry platform for issues tracking and performance monitoring.
